# XYMap

The `XYMap` class represents one XY-grid of interconnected map-legend components. It's built from an
ASCII representation, where unique characters represents each type of component. The Map parses the
map into an internal graph that can be efficiently used for pathfinding the shortest route between
any two nodes (rooms).

Each room (MapNode) can have exits (links) in 8 cardinal directions (north, northwest etc) as well
as up and down. These are indicated in code as 'n', 'ne', 'e', 'se', 's', 'sw', 'w',
'nw', 'u' and 'd'.

    XYMAP_DATA_LIST = [
        XYMAP_DATA
    ]

```

The two `+` signs  in the upper/lower left corners are required and marks the edge of the map area.
The origo of the grid is always two steps right and two up from the bottom test marker and the grid
extends to two lines below the top-left marker. Anything outside the grid is ignored, so numbering
the coordinate axes is optional but recommended for readability.

The XY positions represent coordinates positions in the game world. When existing, they are usually
represented by Rooms in-game. The links between nodes would normally represent Exits, but the length
of links on the map have no in-game equivalence except that traversing a multi-step link will place
you in a location with an XY coordinate different from what you'd expect by a single step (most
games don't relay the XY position to the player anyway).

In the map string, every XY coordinate must have exactly one spare space/line between them - this is
used for node linkings. This finer grid which has 2x resolution of the `XYgrid` is only used by the
mapper and is referred to as the `xygrid` (small xy) internally. Note that an XY position can also
be held by a link (for example a passthrough).

The nodes and links can be customized by add your own implementation of `MapNode` or `MapLink` to
the LEGEND dict, mapping them to a particular character symbol. A `MapNode` can only be added
on an even XY coordinate while `MapLink`s can be added anywhere on the xygrid.

See `./example.py` for a full grid example.

class XYMap:
    r"""
    This represents a single map of interconnected nodes/rooms, parsed from a ASCII map
    representation.

    Each room is connected to each other as a directed graph with optional 'weights' between the the
    connections. It is created from a map string with symbols describing the topological layout. It
    also provides pathfinding using the Dijkstra algorithm.

    The map-string is read from a string or from a module.  The grid area of the string is marked by
    two `+` characters - one in the top left of the area and the other in the bottom left.
    The grid starts two spaces/lines in from the 'open box' created by these two markers and extend
    any width to the right.
    Any other markers or comments can be added outside of the grid - they will be ignored.  Every
    grid coordinate must always be separated by exactly one space/line since the space between
    are used for links.

                will receive the MapNode or MapLink object for every step of the path and and
                must return the suitable string to display at the position of the node/link.
            max_size (tuple, optional): A max `(width, height)` to crop the displayed
                return to. Make both odd numbers to get a perfect center. Set either of
                the tuple values to `None` to make that coordinate unlimited. Set entire
                tuple to None let display-size able to grow up to full size of grid.
            indent (int, optional): How far to the right to indent the map area (only
                applies to `return_str=True`).
            return_str (bool, optional): Return result as an already formatted string
                or a 2D list.

        Returns:
            str or list: Depending on value of `return_str`. If a list,
                this is 2D grid of lines, [[str,str,str,...], [...]] where
                each element is a single character in the display grid. To
                extract a character at (ix,iy) coordinate from it, use
                indexing `outlist[iy][ix]` in that order.

        Notes:
            If outputting a list, the y-axis must first be reversed before printing since printing
            happens top-bottom and the y coordinate system goes bottom-up. This can be done simply
            with this before building the final string to send/print.

                printable_order_list = outlist[::-1]

            If mode='nodes', a `dist` of 2 will give the following result in a row of nodes:

               #-#-@----------#-#

            This display may thus visually grow much bigger than expected (both horizontally and
            vertically). consider setting `max_size` if wanting to restrict the display size. Also
            note that link 'weights' are *included* in this estimate, so if links have weights > 1,
            fewer nodes may be found for a given `dist`.

            If mode=`scan`, a dist of 2 on the above example would instead give

                #-@--

            This mode simply shows a cut-out subsection of the map you are on. The `dist` is
            measured on xygrid, so two steps per XY coordinate. It does not consider links or
            weights and may also show nodes not actually reachable at the moment:
