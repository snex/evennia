Custom Evennia launcher command option for maintaining the grid in a separate process than the main
server (since this can be slow).

To use, add to the settings:
::

    EXTRA_LAUNCHER_COMMANDS.update({'xyzgrid': 'evennia.contrib.grid.xyzgrid.launchcmd.xyzcommand'})

You should now be able to do
::

    evennia xyzgrid <options>

"""

_HELP_LIST = """
list

    Lists the map grid structure and any loaded maps.

list <Z|mapname>

    Display the given XYmap in more detail. Also 'show' works. Use quotes around
    map-names with spaces.

Examples:

    evennia xyzgrid list
    evennia xyzgrid list mymap
    evennia xyzgrid list "the small cave"
"""

_HELP_INIT = """
init

    First start of the grid. This will create the XYZGrid global script. No maps are loaded yet!
    It's safe to run this command multiple times; the grid will only be initialized once.

Example:

    evennia xyzgrid init
"""


_HELP_ADD = """
add <path.to.xymap.module> [<path> <path>,...]

    Add path(s) to one or more modules containing XYMap definitions. The module will be parsed
    for

    - a XYMAP_DATA - a dict on this form:
        {"map": mapstring, "zcoord": mapname/zcoord, "legend": dict, "prototypes": dict}
        describing one single XYmap, or
    - a XYMAP_DATA_LIST - a list of multiple dicts on the XYMAP_DATA form. This allows for
        embedding multiple maps in the same module. See evennia/contrib/grid/xyzgrid/example.py
        for an example of how this looks.

    Note that adding a map does *not* spawn it. If maps are linked to one another, you should
    add all linked maps before running 'spawn', or you'll get errors when creating transitional
    exits between maps.

Examples:

    evennia xyzgrid add evennia.contrib.grid.xyzgrid.example
    evennia xyzgrid add world.mymap1 world.mymap2 world.mymap3
"""

_HELP_SPAWN = """
spawn

    spawns/updates the entire database grid based on the added maps. For a new grid, this will
    spawn all new rooms/exits (and may take a good while!). For updating, rooms may be
    removed/spawned if a map changed since the last spawn.

spawn "(X,Y,Z|mapname)"

    spawns/updates only a part of the grid. Remember the quotes around the coordinate (this
    is mostly because shells don't like them)! Use '*' as a wild card for XY coordinates.
    This should usually only be used if the full grid has already been built once - otherwise
    inter-map transitions may fail! Z is the name/z-coordinate of the map to spawn.

Examples:

    evennia xyzgrid spawn                  - spawn all
    evennia xyzgrid "(*, *, mymap1)"       - spawn everything of map/zcoord mymap1
    evennia xyzgrid "(12, 5, mymap1)"      - spawn only coordinate (12, 5) on map/zcoord mymap1
"""

_HELP_INITPATH = """
initpath

    Recreates the pathfinder matrices for the entire grid. These are used for all shortest-path
    calculations. The result will be cached to disk (in mygame/server/.cache/). If not run, each
    map will run this automatically first time it's used. Running this will always force to
    respawn the cache.

initpath Z|mapname

    recreate the pathfinder matrix for a specific map only. Z is the name/z-coordinate of the
    map. If the map name has spaces in it, use quotes.

Examples:

    evennia xyzgrid initpath
    evennia xyzgrid initpath mymap1
    evennia xyzgrid initpath "the small cave"
"""

_HELP_DELETE = """
delete

    WARNING: This will delete the entire xyz-grid (all maps), and *all* rooms/exits built to
    match it (they serve no purpose without the grid). You will be asked to confirm before
    continuing with this operation.

delete Z|mapname

    Remove a previously added XYmap with the name/z-coordinate Z. If the map was built, this
    will also wipe all its spawned rooms/exits. You will be asked to confirm before continuing
    with this operation. Use quotes if the Z/mapname contains spaces.
